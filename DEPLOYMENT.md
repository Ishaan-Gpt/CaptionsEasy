# Sprint 1.6 — Deployment Runbook

This sprint is shipping, not coding. Items marked **[YOU]** require your
accounts/credentials/dashboard access — I cannot do these for you. Items
marked **[DONE]** are already prepared in this repo.

## Pre-Deploy Checklist

Run through this before touching Render/Vercel — catches the local,
fixable issues before they become live-deployment debugging.

- [ ] Alembic migrations are clean (`alembic upgrade head` runs without error against a fresh DB)
- [ ] All backend tests pass (`pytest` — see Sprint 1.4/1.5 test suites)
- [ ] Frontend builds successfully (`pnpm --filter frontend build`)
- [ ] Docker image builds locally (`docker build -f apps/backend/Dockerfile -t motionai-backend .`)
- [ ] FFmpeg available in the container (`docker run --rm motionai-backend ffmpeg -version`)
- [ ] Fireworks API key verified (a real transcription call against it succeeds, not just that the key is set)
- [ ] Supabase database reachable (`psql` or `alembic` against `DATABASE_URL` succeeds)
- [ ] Supabase Storage bucket created (and private — see section 0 below)
- [ ] Redis reachable (`redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping`)
- [ ] Worker starts successfully (`celery -A app.worker.celery_app worker --loglevel=info` reaches "ready" with no import errors)
- [ ] Backend health endpoint returns 200 (`GET /health` and `/health/ready` locally)
- [ ] Frontend can reach backend (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set, a request succeeds against the local/staged backend)
- [ ] Upload succeeds end-to-end locally
- [ ] Transcript generated (real Fireworks call, not the dummy provider)
- [ ] Transcript stored in database (row exists in `transcripts` table)
- [ ] Logs contain no unhandled exceptions during the above

## 0. Prerequisites — accounts

- **[YOU]** Fireworks AI account + API key (https://fireworks.ai). You said
  Supabase is already set up but Fireworks still needs an account/key.
- **[YOU]** Render account (https://render.com) — backend + worker + Redis.
- **[YOU]** Vercel account (https://vercel.com) — frontend.
- **[DONE]** Supabase: confirm you have, from your existing project's
  Settings > API / Database pages:
  - Project URL (`SUPABASE_URL`)
  - Service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
  - JWT secret (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, Settings > API > JWT Settings)
  - Async DB connection string (`DATABASE_URL_ASYNC`, use the `postgresql+asyncpg://...` form of your connection string)
  - Sync DB connection string (`DATABASE_URL`, `postgresql+psycopg2://...` form, used only by Alembic)
  - Storage bucket name (`SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`) — create one (e.g. `videos`) under Storage if it doesn't exist yet, and make sure it is **not** public (Storage clients use the service role key, never a public URL).

## 1. Backend + worker + Redis — Render

**[DONE]** `apps/backend/Dockerfile` and `render.yaml` (repo root) define:
- `motionai-backend` — web service running `uvicorn`, health check at `/health`, runs `alembic upgrade head` before each deploy.
- `motionai-worker` — same image, runs `celery -A app.worker.celery_app worker`.
- `motionai-redis` — managed Redis, connection string wired into both services automatically.

**[YOU]** in the Render dashboard:
1. New > Blueprint, point at this repo/branch — Render reads `render.yaml` and creates all three services.
2. For **both** `motionai-backend` and `motionai-worker`, set these env vars (Render does not let a blueprint commit secrets, so these must be added manually):
   - `DATABASE_URL_ASYNC`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` (and leave `FIREWORKS_BASE_URL`/`FIREWORKS_SPEECH_MODEL` at their defaults unless you need to override)
   - `SPEECH_PROVIDER_NAME=fireworks` (currently defaults to `dummy` — this is the one switch that turns on the real provider)
   - `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=["https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app"]` (you'll know this URL after step 2 below — come back and set it)
3. Deploy. Watch the build logs for the `pip install` + `alembic upgrade head` step on `motionai-backend`.

## 2. Frontend — Vercel

**[YOU]** in the Vercel dashboard:
1. New Project > import this repo.
2. Root Directory: `apps/frontend` (this is a pnpm workspace — Vercel needs to know the frontend isn't at the repo root).
3. Framework preset: Next.js (auto-detected). Install command: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (Vercel usually auto-detects pnpm from `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
4. Env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-render-backend>.onrender.com/api/v1` (get the exact URL from the Render dashboard after step 1 deploys). This is the only frontend env var (`apps/frontend/.env.example`) — the frontend has no direct Supabase client, auth/storage go through the backend API.
5. Deploy. Note the resulting `*.vercel.app` URL, then go back to Render and set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to that exact URL (step 1.2).

No custom domain for now, per your answer — ship on the default `*.onrender.com` / `*.vercel.app` subdomains; a custom domain is a drop-in addition later in both dashboards.

## 3. Connect everything — checklist

- [ ] Fireworks: real API key set, `SPEECH_PROVIDER_NAME=fireworks`
- [ ] Supabase Auth: frontend logs in against the real Supabase project (no mock auth)
- [ ] Supabase Database: `alembic upgrade head` ran cleanly against the real Postgres
- [ ] Supabase Storage: bucket exists, service role key has access, uploads land there
- [ ] Redis: Render-managed instance, both backend and worker point at the same `REDIS_URL`
- [ ] Celery worker: shows "ready" in Render logs, picks up a test job

## 4. End-to-end verification

Run exactly: Login → Create Project → Upload MP4 → worker picks job → audio
extracted → Fireworks transcript → transcript validated → transcript stored
→ status = completed → frontend displays transcript. Nothing else (no
captions, no rendering — out of scope for this sprint).

Check `GET /health/ready` on the deployed backend first — it reports
`database`/`redis` reachability and will catch most "it's not connected"
problems before you even try the UI flow.

### Post-Deploy Verification

Walk through this against the live `*.onrender.com` / `*.vercel.app` URLs,
not localhost:

- [ ] Login
- [ ] Create Project
- [ ] Upload MP4
- [ ] Job queued (visible in Render worker logs or job status endpoint)
- [ ] Worker processes job
- [ ] Transcript completed (status = completed, not stuck in processing)
- [ ] Transcript visible in UI
- [ ] Failed uploads handled correctly (bad file type / oversize gets a clean error, not a 500 or a hung job)
- [ ] Logs clean (no unhandled exceptions in backend or worker logs during the run)
- [ ] Health endpoint healthy (`/health/ready` returns 200 with both checks true)

## 5. Known deployment failure points to check if something breaks

- **CORS**: `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` must exactly match the Vercel origin (scheme + host, no trailing slash). `app/main.py` already reads this from config — no code change needed, just the env var.
- **Upload limits**: Render's default request body limit and `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` (`app/core/config.py`) must agree — large videos can be rejected by the platform before your own limit even applies.
- **Worker connectivity**: worker and backend must use the identical `REDIS_URL` — in the blueprint both pull from the same `motionai-redis` service, so this should already be correct.
- **FFmpeg path**: `apps/backend/Dockerfile` installs `ffmpeg` via apt; `FfmpegAudioExtractor` shells out to the bare `ffmpeg` command, which works as long as the Dockerfile's apt-get step succeeds — check build logs if transcription fails with a "ffmpeg not found" style error.
- **Storage permissions**: bucket must be private; `SupabaseStorageClient` uses the service role key, not anon key — if uploads/downloads 403, double-check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is the service role key, not the anon/public key.
- **Reverse proxy / timeouts**: Fireworks transcription of a long video can take a while — `FIREWORKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (config.py) controls the provider's own HTTP timeout; Render's own request timeout only matters for the synchronous API, not the Celery worker, so this should mainly affect worker-side calls, which aren't subject to a web request timeout.

## 6. Manual QA matrix

Test against the live deployed app (not local):
- [ ] 20–30 varied real MP4s
- [ ] Silent video (expect speech stage to fail validation, job marked failed — not a crash)
- [ ] A long video (several minutes) — check `FIREWORKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is generous enough
- [ ] A corrupted/truncated upload (expect a clean 4xx, not a worker crash)
- [ ] Different aspect ratios (portrait/landscape — orthogonal to audio extraction, should just work)
- [ ] Non-English audio, if you want to confirm language auto-detection
- [ ] A large file near `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES`
- [ ] Two uploads started at the same time (confirms worker concurrency/locking from Sprint 1.3 holds up for real)

Log what actually breaks — that's the point of this step.

## 7. Tag

Once section 4 passes end-to-end against the live URLs and section 6's QA
matrix has been run for real:

```
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0   # only if/when you want the tag on the remote
```

I haven't tagged yet — tagging is the last step, after you've verified the
live app actually works, not before.
